# Personal Website

This is my personal website built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Go. It serves as a platform to showcase my recent GitHub commits and provides links to my other applications in the navigation bar.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated websites.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and scalability.
- [Go](https://golang.org/): A statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency support.

## Functionality

- **GitHub Commits**: The website fetches and displays data on my recent GitHub commits, allowing visitors to see my latest contributions.
- **Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar provides links to my other applications, allowing visitors to explore my portfolio and other projects.

## Marketing and Learning

This personal website serves as a tool for marketing myself and showcasing my skills to potential employers or collaborators. Additionally, it allows me to learn and experiment with new technologies, such as Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Go. By building this website, I can expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest web development trends.

## Deployment

The website is deployed using Vercel, which provides a seamless integration with Next.js and offers serverless functions through their edge network. These edge functions are implemented using Go, allowing for efficient and performant server-side logic.

Feel free to explore the website and reach out to me if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration!
